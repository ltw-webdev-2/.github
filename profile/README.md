# Web Dev 2 · Learn the Web

The web is accessible to all human beings on the planet. Using grid 
systems, type systems, and reusable code, students construct modular and
 flexible web architectures to support the many different screen 
dimensions, platforms, and needs of people connected to the web.

## Learn the Web

**Learning code doesn’t have to be confounding.**

There are too many topics and too many tutorials online. It’s hard to figure 
you which are up-to-date and even harder to figure out what order to 
follow them.

Learn the Web, is a structured, curated, living guide to web development for graphic 
designers—presenting the information in a logical, targeted order that 
goes from a basic mobile-friendly webpage to a complex multi-screen 
interactive website.

## Thomas J Bradley

I believe that everybody should perpetually learn, try, build, break, 
& fix things—the Open Web is the perfect platform for exactly that.
